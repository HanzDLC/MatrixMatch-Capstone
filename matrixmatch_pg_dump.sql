The system employs speech recognition technology to convert spoken words into text, which is then processed to detect offensive language. vi Once detected, the explicit segments are bleeped to prevent inappropriate audio content from being heard. The video filtering module integrates 3D ResNet-18, a pre-trained deep learning model, to analyze video frames and identify kissing scenes. The detected explicit frames are blurred, ensuring that inappropriate visual content is obscured while maintaining the natural flow of the video. To evaluate the system’s performance, accuracy and F1-score were used as key metrics. The results demonstrate that the BiLSTM + BERT model for profanity detection achieves high accuracy in identifying explicit words, while the 3D ResNet-18 model effectively detects and blurs kissing scenes. The system was also assessed using ISO 25010 software quality standards, ensuring functionality, usability, and performance efficiency. The profanity detection component demonstrated strong performance achieving an accuracy of 90% and a F1-score of 90%, while the kissing detection component achieved promising results, achieving an accuracy of 79% and a F1-score of 84%. These findings suggest effective capabilities in automated video content moderation for explicit content. The researchers concludes that the developed system provides an effective and automated solution for filtering explicit content in videos. Future enhancements may include multilingual support for profanity detection and improved contextual understanding of explicit content.	BSCS

58	AbTech: A Rescue App for Instantaneous Emergency Response and First Aid Station Connectivity using Dijkstra’s Algorithm	Road traffic accidents are a leading cause of fatalities and injuries worldwide, often worsened by delayed emergency responses. This study introduces an automated accident detection and alert system using smartphones to reduce response times and casualties. The system monitors speed and location data to detect sudden changes indicative of a crash and triggers alerts to the nearest responders using Dijkstra’s algorithm for optimal routing. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the fastest way to get help to the accident site. It works by creating a map where places like the accident location, hospitals, and responder stations are shown as points (called nodes), and the roads between them are lines (called edges) with travel times. The algorithm then finds the shortest route from the accident location to the nearest responder. Evaluations under ISO 25010 standards yielded a high overall score of 4.7, highlighting strong performance in functionality, efficiency, reliability, and usability. The system effectively improves emergency response times and enhances road safety by ensuring responders take the most efficient routes	BSCS
59	TeachAR: An Interactive Learning Mobile Application Using Convolutional Neural Network	The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted early childhood education, shifting learning from traditional face-to-face instruction to modular and online formats. While students gradually adapted, this transition exacerbated concerns about short attention spans and hyperactivity among young learners. Returning to in-person classes further highlighted these challenges, as teachers struggled to re-engage students accustomed to self-directed, screen-based learning. In response to these issues, this study introduces TeachAR, an interactive learning mobile application that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance early childhood education. The development of TeachAR followed the Throw-away Prototyping SDLC model, which allowed the development team to quickly create a working prototype to gather user feedback and refine the system's functionality and user interface. This iterative approach was instrumental in addressing usability concerns and aligning the application with the needs of its young target users, as well as the expectations of educators and guardians. iv For the intelligent object recognition feature, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm—specifically the YOLOv5 architecture—was implemented using Python, with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch to support CNN-based training and real-time educational object detection. These technologies enabled the accurate classification of key learning elements such as letters, numbers, and shapes, which are crucial in early education. The system achieves its objectives, with an end evaluation resulting in an overall mean score of 4.6, indicating that the system meets a very high-quality standard according to ISO 25010 International Standards. This underscores TeachAR’s excellent quality and suitability for practical use, affirming its potential to address the attention and engagement challenges faced by young learners in the post-pandemic educational landscape.

92	LEAFLENS: DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE APPLICATION USING IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR OPTIMAL RICE HARVESTING AND FERTILIZATION	Rice farming remains an essential component of food security in the Philippines. Despite technological advancements, many local farmers continue to assess nitrogen levels in rice crops manually by relying on the Leaf Color Chart (LCC), a traditional tool for determining leaf health based on color. While widely used, this method is subjective and prone to inaccuracies, as it heavily depends on human perception and environmental conditions. The primary problem identified in this study is the inefficiency and unreliability of manual leaf color assessment, which often leads to improper fertilizer application. This v may result in either nutrient deficiency or over-fertilization, negatively affecting crop yield. To address this issue, the researchers developed LeafLens, a mobile application designed to assist farmers in evaluating the nitrogen status of rice leaves through image analysis. The application utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the MobileNetV2 architecture, to classify rice leaf colors accurately and provide data-driven recommendations regarding fertilizer application and optimal harvest timing. The findings of the study indicate that LeafLens achieved high accuracy in classifying leaf color. The application successfully delivered appropriate fertilizer suggestions and harvest period estimates. These results demonstrate the potential of LeafLens to support precision farming and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.	BSIT
